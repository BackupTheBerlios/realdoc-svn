Installation guide for GNU and similar:

Requirements:
 Python 2.4 or higher
 libxml2 for Python (optional!)


1) Edit the file "Makefile" and check the PREFIX and PYTHON_VERSION variables.
   If they are not to your liking, alter them as you please.

2) Run "make install"

Optional:

3) Test realdoc by running "realdoc test/" and check out the
   resulting XML in the directory "testpackage".
   If you have libxml2 and libxslt for Python installed you can add the
   -x option to transform the XML file to XHTML.


Installation guide for Windows (unstested):
1) After unzipping/untaring, just run "python rd.py" from that location.


If anybody can volounteer to write a better installer, drop me a mail
